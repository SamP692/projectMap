# projectMap

##Project MVP
This will be an application that can map out simple coding projects. I believe, for the first edition of this project, the mapping mechanism will be based upon Vanilla JavaScript and the React library. This will really only be relevant because I intend for the mapping mechanism to offer built-in features such as an option to note what props need to be passed from one component/class to the next. Users will be able to construct their projects using an Object Oriented approach or a Functional approach.


##Technologies
Strictly React (aside from HTML/CSS, obviously)--no APIs.


##Next Steps
First I need to figure out exactly how the user might want/need to experience the mapping mechanism. Next I'll have to build out components based on that. Then I'll map out the components in relation to each other which will allow me to determine where different data needs to live and what each component will need passed through as props.


##Bonuses
I'd like to institute a feedback feature where feedback can both be stored and reviewed by myself as well as users. Otherwise, I'd like to offer more features if I have time. As in, I'd like for someone building a React project to be able to map their project in a way that accounts for as many different approaches and variables as possible.
