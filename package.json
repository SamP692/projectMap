  "description": "##Project MVP This will be an application that can map out simple coding projects. I believe, for the first edition of this project, the mapping mechanism will be based upon Vanilla JavaScript and the React library. This will really only be relevant because I intend for the mapping mechanism to offer built-in features such as an option to note what props need to be passed from one component/class to the next. Users will be able to construct their projects using an Object Oriented approach or a Functional approach.",
